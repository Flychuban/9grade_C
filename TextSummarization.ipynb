              "['In Pictures A seven-year space voyage came to its climactic end\\xa0when a NASA capsule landed in the desert in the US state of Utah, carrying to Earth the largest asteroid sample ever collected. Scientists have high hopes for the sample, which landed on Sunday, saying it will provide a better understanding of the formation of our solar system and how Earth became habitable. The 6.21-billion-km (3.86-billion-mile) journey marked the United States’ first sample return mission of its kind, the US space agency said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. NASA chief Bill Nelson hailed the mission and said the asteroid dust “will give scientists an extraordinary glimpse into the beginnings of our solar system”. The OSIRIS-REx probe sent its sample capsule into a fiery, perilous descent through Earth’s atmosphere, but NASA managed to engineer a soft landing at 8:52am (14:52 GMT) in the military’s Utah Test and Training Range. Four years after its 2016 launch, the probe had landed on the Asteroid Bennu and collected what NASA estimated is 250g (9oz) of dust from its rocky surface. OSIRIS-REx released its capsule from an altitude of more than 107,826km (67,000 miles). The fiery passage through the atmosphere came only in the last 13 minutes as the capsule hurtled downward with temperatures of up to 2,760 degrees Celsius (5,000 degrees Fahrenheit).

Scientists are exulting over the safe arrival of a canister containing about a cup\\'s worth of asteroid rocks, collected 200 million miles away, that landed in a Utah desert after a 7-year NASA mission sent to retrieve them.  The black pebbles and dirt are older than Earth, and are undisturbed remnants of the solar system\\'s early days of planet formation. As part of an asteroid named Bennu, these rocks traveled unsullied through space for eons.  While bits of asteroids regularly fall to our planet as meteorites, scientists want to study pristine asteroid material, stuff that\\'s uncontaminated by our planet, to understand the early chemistry that might have contributed to the emergence of life.  That\\'s why scientists immediately whisked the returned capsule into a nearby clean room and put it under a cloak of nitrogen gas to protect it from the Earth\\'s atmosphere as it\\'s transported to NASA\\'s Johnson Space Center in Houston.  \\n                This image taken from video provided by NASA TV shows the capsule released by the Osiris-Rex spacecraft being lifted off by a helicopter after landing to Earth in Utah.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n This image taken from video provided by NASA TV shows the capsule released by the Osiris-Rex spacecraft being lifted off by a helicopter after landing to Earth in Utah. Researchers anticipate getting to open up the sealed sample canister there either late Monday or early Tuesday — something they have dreamed of for nearly two decades.   \"Today capped the end of an almost 20-year adventure for me,\" says Dante Lauretta, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona and the leader of NASA\\'s OSIRIS-REx mission. \"I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people to lay eyes on the capsule, and boy did we stick that landing.\"  He\\'s eager to start analyzing the asteroid rock, to see what surprises it might hold.  \"We think we\\'ve got a lot of sample in that science canister,\" says Lauretta, \"and we can\\'t wait to crack into it.\" NASA\\'s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft launched in 2016 and in 2018 finally reached Bennu, a rubble pile of an asteroid about the size of the Empire State Building. The spacecraft tagged along with the space rock for nearly two years and in 2020 it finally dipped down and briefly touched Bennu to gather a sample.  Scientists weren\\'t sure exactly how much rock the spacecraft collected, and knew they\\'d only find out if its return capsule made it home.  The $1-billion mission culminated in triumph after a nail-biting final 13 minutes on Sunday morning, when the capsule entered the atmosphere at 36 times the speed of sound and fell towards a military training range in a desert near Salt Lake City.  Mission scientists anxiously awaited the deployment of the orange-and-white parachutes that would slow its fall. Without that parachute, the capsule might have crash-landed and broken open.  Lauretta says he was in a helicopter, listening to updates from mission controllers, and mentally preparing himself for the worst if the parachute failed. \"And then we heard \\'main chute detected,\\' and I literally broke into tears,\" he recalls. \"That was the moment I knew we made it home.\" He says he felt pride, awe, gratitude, overwhelming relief, and had to convince himself it wasn\\'t a dream.  \"It\\'s the end of a journey and the beginning of a new one,\" says Lauretta, adding that the laboratory investigation ahead is his focus now.  Mission managers tracked the fall of the capsule with radar and deployed helicopters in order to retrieve it once it safely touched down in the desolate desert.  The capsule, blackened from its fiery reentry through the atmosphere, looked almost like a UFO-shaped charcoal briquette, the size of a mini-fridge. \"It looked perfect. There was no sign of any damage,\" says Lauretta. \"It was like seeing an old friend that you hadn\\'t seen for a long time.\" He said he wanted to give it a hug. \"But I knew it would be all sooty,\" Lauretta jokes. \"It was amazing and emotional. I\\'ve been emotional all day and that was one of the key moments for me.\"  Researchers took environmental samples of the air and dirt around the landing site, just to ensure that if any kind of contamination did occur, they\\'d know what the capsule had been exposed to.  As part of the preparation for getting it ready to travel, workers in a clean room removed the back shell of the heat shield that covered and protected the metal science canister full of extraterrestrial rocks. All of the hardware appeared to be in good condition, says NASA\\'s Eileen Stansbery, adding that it looked much like it did prior to launch, before it traveled over a billion miles through space.   \"It was extremely clean on the inside,\" says Stansbery. \"It was beautiful, clean, an extraordinary experience of seeing that the spacecraft itself must have worked extraordinarily well, that all of the engineering that went in to ensure that the science canister was going to remain clean did their jobs.\"  After it arrives at the NASA center in Houston, the canister will be opened in a special lab designed to allow researchers to study its contents while keeping the material untainted.  The earliest samples to get analyzed will probably be bits of dust that escaped a rock collection device that is locked up inside the canister.  Then researchers will slowly and methodically take apart a collection device that\\'s inside the canister. That\\'s the gizmo that actually touched the surface of the asteroid and holds the rocks.  The final opening of that, revealing the biggest rocks, is expected to come in the first week of October. NASA is planning an event on October 11 in which they will show off their treasure and reveal what\\'s been learned so far.   While Japan previously brought back small amounts of dirt from a different asteroid, the new haul is the most extraterrestrial stuff brought home since the Apollo astronauts returned with moon rocks.  NASA is currently working on another mission to return rocks from Mars, and Lauretta is already dreaming of a sample return mission from a comet.  But first, he\\'s going to pore over the bits of an asteroid that he\\'s devoted so much of his life to obtaining.  \"I have to be patient and I\\'m really exercising patience,\" says Lauretta, who notes that he couldn\\'t just shake the returned capsule like a kid trying to figure out what was inside a wrapped Christmas present. \"We\\'ve got a busy week ahead of us.\"   Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor',\n",
              " 'The OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample hitches a ride on a helicopter after landing in the desert in Utah during Sunday. NASA\\'s tire-size space capsule carrying pieces of the asteroid Bennu came barreling through Earth\\'s atmosphere at 27,000 mph from deep space and successfully plopped down in the desert in Utah during Sunday\\'s planned landing. The sample return marked a mission success for NASA\\'s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security–Regolith Explorer. On Sunday, the spacecraft released a capsule containing about 9 ounces of rocks, dust and dirt collected from the asteroid Bennu in 2020. About four hours later, the sample landed inside the Defense Department’s Utah Test and Training Range. The target landing zone was an area about the size of Rhode Island, about 80 miles from\\xa0Salt Lake City.\\xa0 On Sunday at 4:42 a.m. MDT, the spacecraft let go of the asteroid sample capsule while flying about 63,000 miles from Earth\\'s surface. The capsule screamed through Earth’s atmosphere at 8:42 a.m. MDT.\\xa0 Multiple tracking assets and aircraft followed the capsule after it separated from OSIRIS-REx.\\xa0 The orange-and-white parachute of the asteroid sample capsule as seen via tracking cameras. (Image: NASA)  (NASA) Ground telescopes tracked the spacecraft, and then an Air Force tracking station in Maui found the tiny object after the separation. Radar tracking antennas at the Utah Test and Training Range continued to monitor the capsule as it got closer to Earth. Infrared cameras picked up the capsule\\'s hot trail, screaming through Earth\\'s atmosphere.\\xa0 A DoD high-altitude camera tracked the orange and white parachute carrying the capsule down to the desert in Utah. The parachute deployed early at about 20,000 feet, instead of the anticipated 5,000 feet above Earth, leading to an early touchdown time, according to NASA. \"Touchdown!\" NASA mission commentators said as the capsule softly touched down at 8:52 a.m. Mountain Time.\\xa0 NASA and Lockheed Martin teams jumped and cheered at mission control as the helicopter cameras showed the capsule and parachute safely resting on the ground. Lockheed Martin built the spacecraft-shaped capsule containing the sample.\\xa0 The capsule release was scheduled for Sunday, regardless of the weather. The landing date was predetermined because late September is when Earth intersects with Bennu\\'s orbit every year. Weather was still necessary for the sample recovery team. The meteorology team at the West Desert Test Center for U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground in Utah has been providing forecasts to help NASA\\'s team prepare for the landing and retrieval. NASA said the only weather concern on Sunday was possible muddy conditions after recent rains in Utah. Helicopters transported the sample retrieval team to collect the sample to bring it back to a temporary clean room at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.\\xa0 NASA and Lockheed Martin teams celebrate after the sample from the asteroid Bennu landed in the desert of Utah on Sunday. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft collected pieces from Bennu in 2020. The recovery team was on the ground walking toward the asteroid sample within 22 minutes after the successful touchdown, wearing boots to combat the mud. Teams quickly confirmed the capsule had not been breached, hopefully leaving the untouched sample in pure form. On Monday, the sample will be transported to NASA\\'s Johnson Space Center in Houston. The space agency said more than 200 scientists worldwide will study the asteroid sample, including from Japan and Canada.\\xa0 NASA\\'s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft got approved for a second mission to study asteroid Apophis when it makes a close flyby of Earth in 2029. After releasing the sample capsule, NASA said the spacecraft fired its thrusters to divert, hitting Earth and continuing to its new mission.\\xa0 OSIRIS-REx will zoom about 480 miles above Earth and continue its journey to study the asteroid Apophis in a few years when it makes a close flyby of our planet. Since it’s onto a new target, the mission will assume a new acronym: OSIRIS-APEX.\\xa0 The mission\\'s current deputy principal investigator, Daniella DellaGiustina, with the University of Arizona, will become the APEX mission principal investigator. Instead of collecting a sample of Apophis, OSIRIS-APEX will use its thrusters to move rocks and dirt around on the asteroid to help the science team learn about its surface properties.\\xa0 The $200 million new mission culminates when Apophis flies by Earth in 2029, close enough that we can see it with the naked eye.\\xa0 \\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or\\n        redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

We did it\" DUGWAY PROVING GROUND, Utah \\u200a— The atmosphere was electric at the U.S. Army\\'s Dugway Proving Ground as all eyes were on the OSIRIS-REx mission\\'s sample return capsule during its 83-mile (133 kilometers) descent from space to the desert floor. Nearly twenty years of planning, problem-solving and patience culminated in a dramatic and highly-choreographed recovery operation that took place at one of the most remote and isolated army bases in the continental United States.\\xa0 Anxiety felt by onlookers was palpable as four helicopters operated by NASA and the U.S. Air Force took off just after 7 a.m. local time from the Michael Army Air Field. They were headed northwest into the barren sands of the U.S. Department of Defense\\'s sprawling Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) nearly an hour before a capsule containing priceless samples of asteroid Bennu was set to enter Earth\\'s atmosphere at 27,000 mph (43,450 km/h). But emotions were much higher aboard one of the helicopters waiting for the capsule.\\xa0 During a press briefing held on Sunday (Sept. 24) in a hangar at Michael Army Airfield, Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for the OSIRIS-REx mission, described what was going through his mind while riding in a recovery helicopter to the capsule\\'s landing zone. Lauretta was on his way to see if the mission he\\'d spent two decades of his life planning for would end with a successful recovery or with a smoking crater in the Utah desert. \"I was just trying to make sure I didn\\'t totally break down in front of an international audience, right? It\\'s like, okay, you got to keep it together,\" Lauretta said regarding his initial uncertainty about whether or not the capsule\\'s two parachutes had opened as designed. Luckily, a few minutes later, word came that the main parachute indeed deployed. And soon after, Lauretta received word that the landing was a resounding success.\\xa0 \"That\\'s when I just emotionally let it go. You know, tears were streaming down my eyes. I was like, okay, that\\'s the only thing I needed to hear. From this point on, we know what to do. We\\'re safe. We\\'re home. We did it.\" Related: NASA\\'s OSIRIS-REx lands samples of asteroid Bennu to Earth after historic 4-billion-mile journey Lauretta elaborated more about the tension and release he experienced as he waited to hear if the capsule\\'s parachute had fully opened as it sped through the atmosphere. \"I knew things were supposed to be happening on a nominal timeline; that I wasn\\'t getting call outs. But again, we could have just have radio dropouts there. And then we heard \\'main chute detected,\\' and I literally broke into tears.\" \"I knew the moment the chute open, that was it. We knew what to do,\" Lauretta continued. \"There were no surprises left. And it was overwhelming relief, gratitude, pride, awe and really trying to convince myself that I wasn\\'t dreaming, that it was actually happening, that the chute was open that the capsule was coming down and we got that science treasure in hand.\"  The uncertainty over the parachute was caused by the fact that mission teams were unable to determine if the capsule\\'s drogue chute had deployed or not. Drogue parachutes (or drogue chutes) are typically smaller parachutes that deploy from a craft moving at high speeds in order to either slow the craft, stabilize its movement or to help deploy a second, larger main parachute. From their vantage points on the ground and in multiple aircraft providing live footage of the capsule\\'s return to Earth, recovery teams were unable to see if the 31.5-inche (80-centimeter) drogue chute had deployed at 102,300 feet (31,181 meters) as planned. During the post-landing press briefing on Sunday, Mike Moreau, deputy project manager for the OSIRIS-REx mission at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, explained that while his team is still unsure if, in fact, the drogue chute deployed at all, it ultimately is a moot point because the main parachute did, in fact, deploy. \"We don\\'t know if the drogue chute deployed. Because we don\\'t know if we can see that in the imagery. The imagery that we saw was not positive,\" Moreau said. \"What we do know is that the main parachute came out. It came out a little bit earlier than we expected, but that time difference was within the family of variation that we expect from the atmosphere. So that is not really a surprise to us.\"  While the capsule\\'s successful landing might be the end of this stage of the mission, drogue chute or not, it marks the beginning of a whole new chapter of groundbreaking science.\\xa0 Lauretta and other scientists around the world can now begin studying the samples and analyzing the Bennu\\'s composition in order glean information about the chemical history of our solar system. The rocks and dust samples taken from asteroid Bennu will be divided up for study among various scientific institutions and space agencies to help scientists around the world begin answering some of the most burning questions about our cosmic neighborhood — and possibly even help us understand how life got started here on Earth.\\xa0 Because asteroids formed when our solar system was quite young, the analysis of these samples could help reveal how water — or even the building blocks of life, such as amino acids — made their way to our planet as asteroids bombarded a young Earth.\\xa0 And, even though these samples will soon be in scientists\\' hands for years of study, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft isn\\'t finished with its groundbreaking scientific mission.\\xa0 While the probe was designed to only take a sample from one asteroid, it still has plenty of science left in store. It will now make a two-year journey to the near-Earth asteroid Apophis under the name OSIRIS-APEX, where it will study the space rock up close to help scientists better understand the characteristics of yet another relic of the early solar system. —\\u200a\\xa0How asteroid Bennu caught NASA\\'s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft by surprise and nearly killed it along the way \\u200a—\\xa0No, the OSIRIS-REx probe will not bring back asteroid space \\'germs\\' \\u200a—\\u200a\\xa0Dramatic sampling shows asteroid Bennu is nothing like scientists expected NASA\\'s OSIRIS-REx mission (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security - Regolith Explorer) launched in 2016 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida to visit asteroid Bennu and collect samples from the space rock for return to Earth.

The asteroid samples were collected by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which flew by Earth early Sunday morning and jettisoned the capsule over a designated landing zone in the Utah desert. The unofficial touchdown time was 8:52 a.m. MT, 3 minutes ahead of the predicted landing time.  The dramatic event —\\xa0which the NASA livestream narrator described as “opening a time capsule to our ancient solar system” —\\xa0marked a major milestone for the United States: The collected rocks and soil were NASA’s first samples brought back to Earth from an asteroid. Experts have said the bounty could help scientists unlock secrets about the solar system and how it came to be, including how life emerged on this planet. Bruce Betts, chief scientist at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization that conducts research, advocacy and outreach to promote space exploration, congratulated the NASA team on what he called an “impressive and very complicated mission,” adding that the asteroid samples are the start of a thrilling new chapter in space history. “It’s exciting because this mission launched in 2016 and so there’s a feeling of, ‘Wow, this day has finally come,’” he said. “But scientifically, it’s exciting because this is an amazing opportunity to study a very complex story that goes way back to the dawn of the solar system.” The samples were gathered from the surface of a near-Earth asteroid known as Bennu. The space rock, which is roughly as tall as the Empire State Building, is located more than 200 million miles away from Earth but orbits in such a way that it occasionally swings within 4.6 million miles of the planet. Bennu’s main draw owes to its age. The asteroid is estimated to have formed in the first 10 million years of the solar system’s existence, making it a pristine remnant from a chaotic time more than 4.5 billion years ago. As such, studying an asteroid’s chemical and physical properties is thought to be one of the best ways to understand the earliest days of the solar system. “They’re pretty well untouched from right around 4.5 billion years ago,” Betts said. “To get insights into these rocks gives real power to not just the science of asteroids but to everything in our solar system.” Researchers are keen to understand what role — if any — asteroids played in the emergence of life on Earth. There are theories, for instance, that asteroids and comets may have delivered water and other building blocks of life to the planet. Bennu has also been of interest to scientists because, like other near-Earth asteroids, it is classified as a potentially hazardous object. NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office previously estimated that there is a 1 in 2,700 chance of Bennu slamming into Earth sometime between the years 2175 and 2199. It’s estimated that the sample return capsule contains around 8.8 ounces of rocky material from Bennu. After it is recovered, the capsule will be transported to a temporary clean room on the military range before being flown to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Agency officials said they hope to open the capsule on Monday or Tuesday, though it may take around a week before scientists can accurately weigh how much rocky material is inside. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft (short for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer) spent nearly two years circling Bennu before using its robotic arm in what was described as a “high five” maneuver to scoop up pieces of the space rock. Early Sunday, the spacecraft jettisoned the samples as it skirted 63,000 miles above Earth’s surface, sending the capsule screaming through the atmosphere at around 27,650 mph. A series of parachutes helped slow the capsule before it touched down in Utah’s western desert. While these are NASA’s first samples collected and brought back from an asteroid, they are not the first in history. Japan’s Hayabusa mission in 2010 delivered to Earth a few micrograms of material from an asteroid called Itokawa. A second mission, dubbed Hayabusa2, delivered to Earth a small sample from an asteroid known as Ryugu in December 2020.\\xa0 The $1 billion OSIRIS-REx spacecraft may have completed its high-profile delivery, but the probe is not yet finished with its journey. After releasing the sample capsule, the spacecraft fired its thrusters to take it beyond Earth and on a course to investigate another asteroid known as Apophis. This space rock, which measures about 1,200 feet across, is projected to come within 20,000 miles of Earth in 2029. As part of its extended mission, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will take careful measurements of the space rock’s orbit. NASA also intends to approach Apophis and use the spacecraft’s gas thrusters to dislodge and study rocky material from the asteroid.

              " '\\nEditor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      An asteroid sample collected by NASA has touched down on Earth, giving scientists the opportunity to learn more about the origins of the solar system and capturing a piece of a massive space rock that has a chance of colliding with our planet in the future. It’s the first time the agency has accomplished such a feat.\\n   \\n      Seven years after launching to space, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft flew by Earth Sunday to deliver the pristine sample from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu.\\n   \\n      OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer, lifted off in 2016 and began orbiting Bennu in 2018. The spacecraft collected the sample in 2020 and set off on its lengthy return trip to Earth in May 2021. The mission traveled 3.86 billion miles total to Bennu and back.\\n   \\n      The spacecraft dropped the sample capsule — containing an estimated 8.8 ounces of asteroid rocks and soil — from a distance of 63,000 miles (102,000 kilometers) above Earth’s surface early Sunday, and entered the planet’s atmosphere at 10:42 a.m. ET while traveling at a speed of about 27,650 miles per hour (44,498 kilometers per hour).\\n   \\n      Parachutes deployed to slow the capsule to a gentle touchdown at 11 miles per hour (17.7 kilometers per hour). The sample landed in the Defense Department’s Utah Test and Training Range about 10 minutes after entering the atmosphere, a few minutes ahead of schedule.\\n   \\n      “Congratulations to the OSIRIS-REx team. You did it,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson. “It brought something extraordinary, the largest asteroid sample ever received on Earth. This mission proves that NASA does big things, things that inspire us, things that unite us. It wasn’t mission impossible. It was the impossible that became possible.”\\n   \\n      OSIRIS-REx is continuing its tour of the solar system — the spacecraft has already set off to capture a detailed look at a different asteroid named Apophis.\\n   \\n      The mission now has a new name: OSIRIS-APEX, for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-APophis EXplorer.\\n   \\n      Four helicopters transported recovery and research teams to the landing site and conducted assessments to make sure the capsule wasn’t damaged in any way, said Rich Burns, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The team confirmed that the capsule was not breached during landing.\\n   \\n      Recovery teams, which have been training for the event for months, retrieved the capsule once it was safe, said Sandra Freund, OSIRIS-REx program manager at Lockheed Martin Space, which partnered with NASA to build the spacecraft, provide flight operations and help recover the 100-pound capsule.\\n   \\n      The initial recovery team, outfitted with protective gloves and masks, ensured that the capsule was cool enough to touch, given that it reached temperatures up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius) during reentry, Burns said. The team also ensured the capsule’s battery didn’t rupture and leak any toxic fumes.\\n   \\n      A science team collected samples from the landing site, including air, dust and dirt particles.\\n   \\n      “One of the key scientific objectives of OSIRIS-REx is to return a pristine sample and pristine means that no foreign materials hamper our investigation during sample analysis,” said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “As unlikely as it is, we do want to make sure any materials that are out there in the Utah range that may interact with the sample are well documented.”\\n   \\n      Lauretta has worked on the mission for nearly twenty years and remembers when it was part of an idea presented to NASA. Lauretta has been present for each step of the way, including when the capsule was assembled and installed on the spacecraft before launch. And on Sunday, he was one of the first people to approach the capsule after it landed to welcome it home.\\n   \\n      “It was like seeing an old friend that you hadn’t seen for a long time,” he said. “I did want to give it a hug. One of the key moments for me was seeing it. I knew we had done it, that we had pulled it off. As incredible as it seemed all those years ago, it came to be.”\\n   \\n      A helicopter carried the sample in a cargo net and delivered it to a temporary clean room near the landing site. Within this space, the curation team will conduct a nitrogen flow, called a purge, to prevent any of Earth’s atmosphere from entering the sample canister and contaminating it. The larger pieces of the capsule will be stripped away, said Nicole Lunning, OSIRIS-REx curation lead at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\\n   \\n      A team will prepare the sample canister for transport on a C-17 aircraft to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston on Monday. Scientists expect to remove the lid to see the sample for the first time on Tuesday.\\n   \\n      The recovery team will also assess all of the footage captured of the descent to determine if the drogue parachute, used to initially stabilize the capsule, deployed on time. At the time it was expected to release, the team was unable to see visual evidence. The main parachute, responsible for slowing down the capsule to a safe landing speed, also deployed early.\\n   \\n      “But at the end of the day, when that main chute deployed, it basically corrected any of the sins that may have happened ahead of it,” said Tim Priser, chief engineer for deep space exploration at Lockheed Martin. “It touched down like a feather.”\\n   \\n      Details about the sample will be revealed through a NASA broadcast from Johnson Space Center on October 11. While the science team will not have had time to fully assess the sample, the researchers plan to collect some fine-grained material at the top of canister Tuesday for a quick analysis that can be shared in October, Lauretta said.

              " 'Advertisement Supported by The seven-year Osiris-Rex mission ended on Sunday with the return of regolith from the asteroid Bennu, which might hold clues about the origins of our solar system and life. transcript “We have confirmed parachute deployment.” “Wow, and after an exhilarating streak across Earth’s atmosphere, we have parachute deployment. You can see just a sigh of relief from the team. I can hear some applause here. You see the reaction there just moments ago as they got that sample back on the ground. The rest of the team members approaching that S.R.C. that has been successfully bagged and prepared to be loaded into the helicopter’s long line. And we have clearance to depart the recovery site. This is a key moment of those recovery operations. We’re already getting that S.R.C out of the landing zone and on its way to the Dugway clean room. In just a few moments, the SR.C. will be back on the ground, its second touchdown of the day, a much calmer one than we had earlier this morning. The doors are now open. We are entering into the clean room and that S.R.C. is about to be moved off onto our clean room fixture. It’s hard to fathom that just a couple of years ago, this sample return capsule that you see here was over 200 million miles away from us on the other side of the solar system.” By Katrina Miller A brown-and-white capsule that spent the last seven years swooping through the solar system — and sojourning at an asteroid — has finally come home. And it has brought a cosmic souvenir: a cache of space rock that scientists are hungry to get their hands on. On Sunday morning, those scientists waited eagerly as the pod shot through Earth’s atmosphere at thousands of miles per hour. It gently parachuted down into the damp desert landscape of the Utah Test and Training Range, about 80 miles west of Salt Lake City, at 8:52 a.m. local time. The capsule’s landing is a major win for a NASA mission called Osiris-Rex, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resources Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer. The spacecraft set out in 2016 to retrieve material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid about 190 feet wider than the height of the Empire State Building. Researchers hope this pristine space dirt will reveal clues about the birth of our solar system and the genesis of life on Earth. “This is a gift to the world,” said Dante Lauretta, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of the Osiris-Rex mission, at a news conference last month. Bill Nelson, the administrator of NASA, said the mission proves the space agency “does big things. Things that inspire us, things that unite us, things that show really nothing is beyond our reach.” The mission’s scientists endured many twists and turns, including a seven-year struggle to get the project greenlit by NASA. Their perseverance paid off as Osiris-Rex became the first American spacecraft to retrieve material from an asteroid, bringing back a staggering amount of matter from space for scientists around the world to study. But the victorious final act means much more for the Osiris-Rex team members, many of whom “grew up on this mission,” according to Dr. Lauretta. “A little bit of us is on that spacecraft,” said Rich Burns, the Osiris-Rex program manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. “And a little bit of us is coming home with it.” Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid, is currently many millions of miles from our planet. Like other asteroids, it is a geological relic of the protoplanetary disk — the swirling mix of gas and dust that eventually coalesced into planets — that surrounded our sun billions of years ago. One theory is that small worlds like Bennu seeded Earth with the prebiotic ingredients for life. But it is difficult to test this idea using meteorites, pieces of asteroids that reach Earth’s surface, which are heated by the atmosphere and are then contaminated by microbes on the ground, Dr. Lauretta said.  This is not the first chunk of an asteroid brought back to Earth. In 2010, the Hayabusa mission, led by the Japanese space agency JAXA, managed, in spite of technical troubles, to recover less than a milligram of material from a near-Earth asteroid named Itokawa. A decade later, a follow-up mission, Hayabusa2, retrieved a few grams of space rock from Ryugu. With that sample, scientists have found evidence suggesting that asteroids had delivered water to the early Earth, and discovered the presence of uracil — a building block of RNA, a molecule that helps form proteins. Osiris-Rex’s delivery will provide an abundant new stock of space rock. The team anticipates about half a pound of unsullied asteroid dirt. Shogo Tachibana, a planetary scientist at the University of Tokyo who led the Hayabusa2 sample analysis and is now a co-investigator on Osiris-Rex, has “no idea” whether Bennu will be anything like Ryugu — but it’s what he is most looking forward to finding out. From the beginning, the mission was a marathon. In 2004, a group of American scientists submitted an application for what would become Osiris-Rex. But NASA returned the project with the lowest ranking: Category 4, or “thanks, but no thanks,” Dr. Lauretta said. “The first proposal just bombed.” The team tried again in 2007. This time, it scored a ranking of Category 1 — but was too expensive to win funding. The third time was the charm. NASA selected the project in 2011. “So that began our real journey,” said Harold Connolly, a cosmochemist at Rowan University who joined Osiris-Rex 15 years ago. The team spent another half-decade “making sure all our little ducks were in a row,” he said, including designing and building the spacecraft, mapping the trek to Bennu and plotting the science campaign. Osiris-Rex launched in 2016, embarking on a roundabout series of fuel-efficient loops before arriving at Bennu on Dec. 3, 2018. The mission repeatedly faced the unexpected. “I call Bennu the trickster,” Dr. Lauretta said endearingly. “Because it has challenged us constantly on this program.” Mission specialists expected Bennu’s surface to consist of smooth, sandy seas of fine particles. But as the asteroid came into focus, they found it was rocky and rough, with boulders, some 10 stories tall, sprinkled throughout. That made finding a place where the spacecraft could safely retrieve a sample from the surface riskier. Engineers were troubleshooting that problem when Bennu threw them another loop: It was spewing rubble into space. That was “really exciting scientifically,” said Sandy Freund, the Osiris-Rex program manager at the aerospace company Lockheed Martin. But “from an engineering standpoint,” the discovery posed a new problem. The mission scientists frantically churned out calculations to make sure Osiris-Rex was safe from being struck by the asteroid’s gravelly plumes. The operations team swiftly wrote new navigation software that could compensate for the rugged terrain on Bennu. The next big hurdle was to select a sample site: a place where the spacecraft could safely fill its canister with fine grain regolith. That was made more difficult by the uneven ground of Bennu. Photos of the asteroid revealed some sandy regions — but only inside bowl-shaped craters. “We got to get inside one of those,” Dr. Lauretta said, to the distress of the operations team. “There’s nowhere else to go.” The margin for error was small. Touch down wrong, and the spacecraft may have faced a fate like Hayabusa, which crash-landed on its asteroid. Or worse: Osiris-Rex comes down on a slope and runs into what Dr. Lauretta calls “the banana peel scenario,” where it slips and falls into a crater. After two years of surveying the asteroid, the mission team chose a spot it named Nightingale, near the asteroid’s north pole. In October 2020, Osiris-Rex punched the surface of Bennu using a tool that was supposed to bounce off Bennu like a pogo stick. But it did not exactly bounce as planned. Dr. Connolly recalled that he was shocked at how deep the instrument penetrated into the asteroid — about one and a half feet. “We thought it would be a little more firm,” he said. “But it turns out gravity is basically the only thing that’s holding it together.” The blow excavated a 30-foot-wide crater and blasted dusty debris into space. The surprises didn’t end there. When the team checked to make sure it had collected a large enough sample, it found the chamber overflowing with regolith. “We had overachieved,” Ms. Freund said. “It was wedged open and leaking into space.” Every movement of the spacecraft led to greater loss of Bennu’s dust, like the way salt comes out of a shaker. The team immediately halted all planned maneuvers to prevent losing any more of its precious cargo. Instead, the crew rushed to stow what remained in the leaky chamber within the return capsule. Six months later, Osiris-Rex captured one last look at Nightingale and then began the two-year journey back to Earth. “It was definitely an adventure,” Dr. Lauretta said. In the days leading up to the sample’s plunge into Earth’s atmosphere, Dr. Lauretta was having trouble sleeping. He tried to push away “all of the doom scenarios” like what happened with NASA’s Genesis probe that collected plasma from the solar wind. In 2004, it crashed into a Utah desert when the parachute for its return capsule failed to deploy. (Despite the rough landing, researchers were able to recover and analyze the sample.) “And that felt like a gut punch then,” Dr. Lauretta said while squeezing a stress ball shaped like the Osiris-Rex capsule. Approaching the latest sample return was “unlike anything I’ve ever felt before,” he added. “I feel like there’s an electric wire at the base of my spine, just tingling.” Michael Puzio, an engineering major at North Carolina State University, also felt “a bit terrified” leading up to the sample’s return. In third grade, Mr. Puzio won a contest to name the asteroid Bennu. It ignited in him a love of space and a dream to be an astronaut. “But I think it’s in good hands,” Mr. Puzio added. The mission team “is pretty good at math, so I’ve heard.” At 2 a.m. local time on Sunday morning, the Osiris-Rex command team in Littleton, Colo., evaluated the landing conditions and voted to order Osiris-Rex to release the capsule at 4:42 a.m. Four hours later, it entered Earth’s atmosphere. A high-altitude camera on a NASA plane captured the fireball streaking across the lavender sky as the capsule’s heat shield protected the cargo from temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The first, smaller parachute should have inflated 19 miles above the surface, though engineers have not yet been able to confirm that it did. The larger main chute deployed at a higher altitude than planned, which led to a landing three minutes earlier than expected. The capsule, charred from its journey through the atmosphere, landed on its nose. About half an hour after the landing, a mission team reached the capsule and began the procedures to recover it. “We scored the first touchdown today,” said Tim Priser, an engineer at Lockheed Martin, at a news conference following the capsule’s landing. Dr. Lauretta was tuned in to the “pulse-pounding” final moments while riding in a helicopter to the landing site when he heard confirmation that the main chute had deployed. “I literally broke into tears,” he said at the post-landing news conference. “That was the moment I knew we made it home.” Approaching the capsule felt like “seeing an old friend that you haven’t seen for a long time,” he added. For Dr. Lauretta, the safe return is both a professional achievement and a personal one: Michael Drake, the first principal investigator of Osiris-Rex, died only five months after the mission was funded. “You need to be the one that finishes the dream,” Dr. Lauretta said Dr. Drake told him. “And so I did.” The capsule and its contents were stowed in a temporary clean room near the Utah landing site and are to be transferred on Monday to Johnson Space Center in Houston. Scientists plan to crack open the capsule on Tuesday for what Dr. Connolly calls a “quick look” analysis. In October, the sample team will reveal the first results to the world, including Bennu’s composition and how it compares with material brought back from the asteroids studied by the Japanese missions. (A potential government shutdown on Oct. 1 may delay those plans.) “It’s the end of a journey and the beginning of a new one,” Dr. Lauretta said. “We’re going into the atomic realm.” Dr. Connolly struggled to express what it meant to him that the mission had come back to Earth. “I feel like a little kid again,” he said. “I’m just so happy to be able to tell the story that these rocks contain.” Scientists will spend the next two years conducting a more robust investigation of the asteroid. Small portions of the sample will be handed off to JAXA and the Canadian Space Agency. Up to 75 percent of Bennu’s regolith will remain in storage so that scientists in the future can “work on the sample with new techniques that we don’t even know exist yet,” Dr. Connolly said. “These samples are an amazing treasure trove for generations,” said Eileen Stansbery, a chief scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, at the post-landing news conference. The Osiris-Rex mission may have come to an end, but the spacecraft remains fully operational in space. It will next visit Apophis, another near-Earth asteroid that was once seen as a major threat to crash into Earth. More recent measurements determined that the asteroid will pass by Earth in 2029, within one-tenth of the distance to the moon. The new project is named Osiris-Apex, where APEX means Apophis Explorer, and may provide information for mitigating more hazardous encounters with asteroids. The leader of Osiris-Apex will be Dani Mendoza DellaGiustina, a former undergraduate student of Dr. Lauretta’s who is now a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona. It is another example of how the journey to Bennu and back has raised a generation of scientists in the field. “I’ve been working on some incarnation of this mission basically my entire adult life,” Dr. DellaGiustina said. She added that while she was “super stoked” about Osiris-Rex’s return, “for me, it’s definitely not the last hurrah.” Katrina Miller is a science reporting fellow for The Times.

              "['\\nEditor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. \\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. \\n \\n      An asteroid sample collected by NASA has touched down on Earth, giving scientists the opportunity to learn more about the origins of the solar system and capturing a piece of a massive space rock that has a chance of colliding with our planet in the future.  It’s the first time the agency has accomplished such a feat. \\n   \\n      Seven years after launching to space, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft flew by Earth Sunday to deliver the pristine sample from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. \\n   \\n      OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer, lifted off in 2016 and began orbiting Bennu in 2018.  The spacecraft collected the sample in 2020 and set off on its lengthy return trip to Earth in May 2021.  The mission traveled 3. 86 billion miles total to Bennu and back. \\n   \\n      The spacecraft dropped the sample capsule — containing an estimated 8. 8 ounces of asteroid rocks and soil — from a distance of 63,000 miles (102,000 kilometers) above Earth’s surface early Sunday, and entered the planet’s atmosphere at 10:42 a. m.  ET while traveling at a speed of about 27,650 miles per hour (44,498 kilometers per hour). \\n   \\n      Parachutes deployed to slow the capsule to a gentle touchdown at 11 miles per hour (17. 7 kilometers per hour).  The sample landed in the Defense Department’s Utah Test and Training Range about 10 minutes after entering the atmosphere, a few minutes ahead of schedule. \\n   \\n      “Congratulations to the OSIRIS-REx team.  You did it,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson.  “It brought something extraordinary, the largest asteroid sample ever received on Earth.  This mission proves that NASA does big things, things that inspire us, things that unite us.  It wasn’t mission impossible.  It was the impossible that became possible. ”\\n   \\n      OSIRIS-REx is continuing its tour of the solar system — the spacecraft has already set off to capture a detailed look at a different asteroid named Apophis. \\n   \\n      The mission now has a new name: OSIRIS-APEX, for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-APophis EXplorer. \\n   \\n      Four helicopters transported recovery and research teams to the landing site and conducted assessments to make sure the capsule wasn’t damaged in any way, said Rich Burns, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.  The team confirmed that the capsule was not breached during landing.',\n",
              " '\\n   \\n      Recovery teams, which have been training for the event for months, retrieved the capsule once it was safe, said Sandra Freund, OSIRIS-REx program manager at Lockheed Martin Space, which partnered with NASA to build the spacecraft, provide flight operations and help recover the 100-pound capsule. \\n   \\n      The initial recovery team, outfitted with protective gloves and masks, ensured that the capsule was cool enough to touch, given that it reached temperatures up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius) during reentry, Burns said.  The team also ensured the capsule’s battery didn’t rupture and leak any toxic fumes. \\n   \\n      A science team collected samples from the landing site, including air, dust and dirt particles. \\n   \\n      “One of the key scientific objectives of OSIRIS-REx is to return a pristine sample and pristine means that no foreign materials hamper our investigation during sample analysis,” said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson.  “As unlikely as it is, we do want to make sure any materials that are out there in the Utah range that may interact with the sample are well documented. ”\\n   \\n      Lauretta has worked on the mission for nearly twenty years and remembers when it was part of an idea presented to NASA.  Lauretta has been present for each step of the way, including when the capsule was assembled and installed on the spacecraft before launch.  And on Sunday, he was one of the first people to approach the capsule after it landed to welcome it home. \\n   \\n      “It was like seeing an old friend that you hadn’t seen for a long time,” he said.  “I did want to give it a hug.  One of the key moments for me was seeing it.  I knew we had done it, that we had pulled it off.  As incredible as it seemed all those years ago, it came to be. ”\\n   \\n      A helicopter carried the sample in a cargo net and delivered it to a temporary clean room near the landing site.  Within this space, the curation team will conduct a nitrogen flow, called a purge, to prevent any of Earth’s atmosphere from entering the sample canister and contaminating it.  The larger pieces of the capsule will be stripped away, said Nicole Lunning, OSIRIS-REx curation lead at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. \\n   \\n      A team will prepare the sample canister for transport on a C-17 aircraft to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston on Monday.  Scientists expect to remove the lid to see the sample for the first time on Tuesday.',\n",
              " '\\n   \\n      The recovery team will also assess all of the footage captured of the descent to determine if the drogue parachute, used to initially stabilize the capsule, deployed on time.  At the time it was expected to release, the team was unable to see visual evidence.  The main parachute, responsible for slowing down the capsule to a safe landing speed, also deployed early. \\n   \\n      “But at the end of the day, when that main chute deployed, it basically corrected any of the sins that may have happened ahead of it,” said Tim Priser, chief engineer for deep space exploration at Lockheed Martin.  “It touched down like a feather. ”\\n   \\n      Details about the sample will be revealed through a NASA broadcast from Johnson Space Center on October 11.  While the science team will not have had time to fully assess the sample, the researchers plan to collect some fine-grained material at the top of canister Tuesday for a quick analysis that can be shared in October, Lauretta said.  The initial analysis will look for the presence of minerals and chemical elements, he said. \\n   \\n      Scientists will analyze the rocks and soil for the next two years at a dedicated clean room inside Johnson Space Center.  The sample will also be divided up and sent to laboratories around the globe, including OSIRIS-REx mission partners at the Canadian Space Agency and Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.  About 70% of the sample will remain pristine in storage so future generations with better technology can learn even more than what’s now possible. \\n   \\n      If a government shutdown occurs, “it will not endanger the curation and safe handling of the asteroid sample,” said Lori Glaze, director for NASA’s Planetary Sciences Division. \\n   \\n      “Certain steps leading to this highly anticipated analysis will possibly be delayed, but the sample will remain protected and safe despite any disruptions to the schedule,” she said during a news conference Friday.  “The sample has waited for more than 4 billion years for humans to study it and if it takes us a little longer, I think we’ll be OK. ”\\n   \\n      Along with a previously returned sample of the asteroid Ryugu from Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission, the rocks and soil could reveal key information about the beginning of our solar system.  Scientists believe that carbonaceous asteroids such as Bennu crashed into Earth early during the planet’s formation, delivering elements like water. \\n   \\n      “Scientists believe that the asteroid Bennu is representative of the solar system’s own oldest materials forged in large dying stars and supernova explosions,” Glaze said.',\n",
              " ' “And for this reason, NASA is investing in these missions devoted to small bodies to increase our understanding of how our solar system formed and how it evolved. ”\\n   \\n      But the sample can also provide insights into Bennu, which has a chance of colliding with Earth in the future. \\n   \\n      It’s crucial to understand more about the population of near-Earth asteroids that may be on an eventual collision course with our planet.  A better grasp of their composition and orbits is key to predicting which asteroids may have the closest approaches to Earth and when — and essential to developing methods of deflecting these asteroids based on their composition. \\n   © 2023 Cable News Network.
